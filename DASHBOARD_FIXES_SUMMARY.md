# üî• Saafe Fire Detection - AWS Dashboard Fixes Summary

## üìã Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Data Format Issue**
**Problem**: The dashboard was expecting JSON data but the S3 bucket contains CSV files.
**Solution**: Updated the data parsing logic to handle CSV format correctly.
- Added CSV parsing using `csv` module and `StringIO`
- Extracted headers and data rows properly
- Converted string values to appropriate numeric types

### 2. **Data Structure Issue**
**Problem**: The thermal data contains pixel values rather than pre-calculated features like 't_mean'.
**Solution**: Updated the data extraction logic to calculate mean temperature from pixel values.
- Iterate through all pixel_* fields to calculate average temperature
- Handle missing or invalid data gracefully
- Use appropriate default values for missing sensor readings

### 3. **Time Range Issue**
**Problem**: The dashboard was looking for data from the last hour, but the most recent data was from several days ago.
**Solution**: Extended the search window and added more informative error messages.
- Increased search window to include data from the last day
- Added fallback to search all recent files if today's data isn't found
- Provided clear guidance when no recent data is available

### 4. **Deprecated Function Issue**
**Problem**: Using deprecated `st.experimental_rerun()` function.
**Solution**: Updated to use current `st.rerun()` function.
- Replaced all instances of `st.experimental_rerun()` with `st.rerun()`
- Verified compatibility with current Streamlit version

### 5. **Port Conflict Issue**
**Problem**: Default port 8501 was already in use.
**Solution**: Changed default port to 8503.
- Updated all documentation and scripts to use port 8503
- Added port selection flexibility

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Changes Made

### Data Retrieval Function (`get_recent_sensor_data`)
- Added CSV parsing capability
- Extended search time window
- Improved error handling
- Added fallback data retrieval mechanism

### Data Display Logic
- Updated to handle pixel-based thermal data
- Added proper data type conversion
- Implemented graceful degradation for missing data
- Enhanced error messages and user guidance

### System Integration
- Fixed deprecated Streamlit functions
- Resolved port conflicts
- Improved overall robustness

## üìä Dashboard Improvements

### Sensor Data Display
- **Temperature**: Now correctly calculates mean from pixel data
- **PM2.5**: Uses default value when not available in data
- **CO**: Properly extracts from gas data
- **Audio Level**: Uses default value when not available

### Fire Detection Scoring
- Updated algorithm to work with available sensor data
- Maintained risk classification (Info, Low, Medium, High)
- Preserved visual indicators and trend visualization

### User Experience
- More informative error messages
- Clear guidance for resolving data issues
- Better handling of edge cases

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Testing Performed
1. **S3 Access Test**: Verified connection to `data-collector-of-first-device` bucket
2. **Data Parsing Test**: Confirmed CSV parsing works correctly
3. **Data Retrieval Test**: Validated that recent data is found and processed
4. **Dashboard Functionality Test**: Ensured all components work together

### Results
- Dashboard now successfully displays sensor data
- Fire detection scoring works with available data
- System status monitoring functions correctly
- Error handling provides useful guidance

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Dashboard**: Check that the dashboard is displaying data correctly at http://localhost:8503
2. **Test Refresh Functionality**: Ensure the refresh button works properly
3. **Validate Fire Detection**: Confirm that risk scoring responds to sensor data changes

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Enhanced Data Processing**: Implement more sophisticated feature extraction from raw sensor data
2. **Real-time Alerts**: Integrate with SNS for alert notifications
3. **Historical Analysis**: Add capabilities for analyzing historical data trends
4. **Multi-property Support**: Extend dashboard to support multiple device locations
