# üî• Fire Detection System - S3 Data Status Report

## üìä Current Status

After analyzing your S3 bucket `data-collector-of-first-device`, I can confirm the following:

### ‚úÖ S3 Connectivity
- **Bucket Status**: ‚úÖ Accessible and operational
- **Permissions**: ‚úÖ Correctly configured
- **AWS Connection**: ‚úÖ Working properly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è No Live Data from Devices
- **Most Recent File**: September 13, 2025 (6+ days ago)
- **Recent Files (Last Hour)**: 0 files
- **Recent Files (Last Day)**: 0 files
- **All Files Are Historical**: The most recent file is from over a week ago

## üéØ Analysis

### What This Means
Your deployed IoT devices are **not currently sending live data** to the S3 bucket. The system is properly configured and can connect to AWS, but no new sensor data is being uploaded.

### Possible Causes
1. **Device Connectivity Issues**
   - Devices may be powered off
   - Internet connectivity problems
   - Network configuration issues

2. **Device Configuration Problems**
   - Incorrect S3 bucket name in device configuration
   - Invalid AWS credentials on devices
   - Wrong file naming conventions

3. **Hardware Issues**
   - Sensor malfunctions
   - Storage capacity issues
   - Device clock synchronization problems

## üîß Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Verify Device Status
- Check if devices are powered on
- Confirm internet connectivity
- Review device logs for errors

### 2. Check Device Configuration
- Verify S3 bucket name is set to: `data-collector-of-first-device`
- Confirm AWS credentials are valid and have proper permissions
- Ensure correct file naming format:
  - Thermal data: `thermal-data/thermal_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
  - Gas data: `gas-data/gas_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

### 3. Monitor System
- Check CloudWatch logs for any processing activity
- Verify that Lambda functions are not reporting errors
- Confirm SageMaker endpoint is operational

## üìà Dashboard Status

### Kitchen Fire Detection Dashboard
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Running at http://localhost:8501
- **Functionality**: Working correctly
- **Data Display**: Shows "No recent live data" warning (correct behavior)

### AWS Dashboard
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Available (saafe_aws_dashboard.py)
- **Functionality**: Can be started with `python3 saafe_aws_dashboard.py`
- **Data Display**: Would show same "No recent live data" warning

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Check Physical Devices**
   - Ensure devices are powered on and connected to the internet
   - Verify sensors are properly connected

2. **Review Device Logs**
   - Look for any error messages in device logs
   - Check for AWS authentication errors

3. **Test Manual Upload**
   - Try manually uploading a test file to verify S3 access from devices

### Long-term Monitoring
1. **Set Up Alerts**
   - Configure CloudWatch alarms for no data detection
   - Set up SNS notifications for system status changes

2. **Regular Health Checks**
   - Schedule periodic verification of device connectivity
   - Monitor file upload frequency
