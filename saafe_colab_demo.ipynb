    "## 🧠 Understanding the AI Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes This System Special?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional fire detection systems rely on simple threshold-based rules (\"if temperature > X, then fire\"). While simple, these approaches suffer from high false alarm rates and can't understand complex patterns. Our system uses advanced AI to understand the **relationships** between sensors and how fire patterns **evolve over time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Spatio-Temporal Transformer Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the AI model as having two types of \"attention\":\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌐 Spatial Attention (\"Where\")\n",
    "- **What it does**: Learns which sensors are most important for each prediction\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: A fire in the kitchen affects kitchen sensors more than bedroom sensors\n",
    "- **How it works**: The model learns to \"pay attention\" to relevant sensor locations\n",
    "- **Real-world benefit**: More accurate detection by focusing on the right sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⏰ Temporal Attention (\"When\")\n",
    "- **What it does**: Understands how sensor patterns change over time\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Fires have characteristic escalation patterns different from cooking\n",
    "- **How it works**: The model learns to recognize time-based signatures\n",
    "- **Real-world benefit**: Distinguishes between temporary spikes and sustained events\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Anti-Hallucination Logic Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "AI models can sometimes be \"overconfident\" in wrong predictions. Our anti-hallucination system acts like a **safety committee** that double-checks every decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🗳️ The Committee Approach\n",
    "1. **Primary AI Model**: Makes the initial prediction\n",
    "2. **Secondary AI Model**: Provides a second opinion\n",
    "3. **Rule-Based Validator**: Checks using traditional logic\n",
    "4. **Final Decision**: At least 2 out of 3 must agree for critical alerts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🍳 Cooking vs. Fire Detection\n",
    "The system specifically looks for patterns that distinguish cooking from fires:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Cooking Pattern | Fire Pattern |\n",
    "|--------|----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Temperature** | Moderate increase (~25-30°C) | Rapid spike (>60°C) |\n",
    "| **Duration** | Temporary (20-40 minutes) | Sustained escalation |\n",
    "| **PM2.5** | High but controlled | Very high with audio |\n",
    "| **Spatial Pattern** | Localized to kitchen | Spreads to other sensors |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🎯 High Accuracy**: AI learns complex patterns humans might miss\n",
    "- **🛡️ Safety First**: Multiple validation layers prevent false alarms\n",
    "- **🧠 Explainable**: System can explain why it made each decision\n",
    "- **⚡ Real-Time**: Fast enough for immediate response\n",
    "- **🔄 Adaptive**: Can learn from new patterns over time"

    "## 3. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This section transforms raw sensor data into the optimal format for the Spatio-Temporal Transformer model. The preprocessing pipeline is crucial for model performance, ensuring consistent scaling, proper temporal windowing, and rich positional encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Preprocessing Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw sensor data varies dramatically in scale (temperature ~20°C, CO₂ ~400ppm, PM2.5 ~10μg/m³). Without proper preprocessing, the model would struggle to learn meaningful patterns across these different measurement scales and temporal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Pipeline Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📊 Data Normalization**: Z-score normalization ensures all features contribute equally\n",
    "2. **🪟 Sliding Windows**: Creates sequential chunks for temporal pattern recognition\n",
    "3. **🎯 Positional Encoding**: Embeds timestamp and spatial location information\n",
    "4. **🔄 Sequence Alignment**: Synchronizes multi-sensor data streams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataNormalizer**: Handles Z-score normalization with feature-specific statistics\n",
    "- **SlidingWindowProcessor**: Creates overlapping time windows for sequence modeling\n",
    "- **PositionalEncoder**: Adds temporal and spatial position embeddings\n",
    "- **SequenceAligner**: Ensures temporal synchronization across sensor types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Window Size**: 60 time steps (configurable) for capturing temporal patterns\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Per-feature Z-score with robust statistics handling\n",
    "- **Positional Encoding**: Sinusoidal encoding for temporal positions, learned embeddings for spatial\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Batch processing to handle large datasets within Colab limits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Assurance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each preprocessing step includes validation to ensure data integrity, proper scaling, and format compatibility with the transformer architecture."

    "This section implements the core AI model: a Spatio-Temporal Transformer specifically designed for multi-sensor fire detection. The model architecture combines the power of transformer attention mechanisms with specialized layers for handling both spatial sensor relationships and temporal patterns.\n",

    "### Why Spatio-Temporal Transformers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches struggle with the complex relationships in sensor networks:\n",
    "- **Spatial Dependencies**: Sensors near a fire source show correlated readings\n",
    "- **Temporal Patterns**: Fire events have characteristic time-based signatures\n",
    "- **Multi-Modal Data**: Different sensor types provide complementary information\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Spatio-Temporal Transformer addresses these challenges through specialized attention mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",

    "Output Projection → Risk Score (0-100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🌐 Spatial Attention**: Learns which sensors are most relevant for each prediction\n",
    "- **⏰ Temporal Attention**: Captures how sensor patterns evolve over time\n",
    "- **🔄 Multi-Head Attention**: Parallel attention heads for different pattern types\n",
    "- **📈 Feed-Forward Networks**: Non-linear transformations for complex pattern recognition\n",
    "- **🎯 Output Projection**: Maps learned representations to risk scores (0-100)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Synthetic training data with labeled scenarios\n",
    "2. **Model Initialization**: Xavier/He initialization for stable training\n",
    "3. **Training Loop**: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling\n",
    "4. **Validation**: Real-time monitoring of training and validation metrics\n",
    "5. **Checkpointing**: Save best model based on validation performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Targets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal Conditions**: Risk scores 0-30 (low false positive rate)\n",
    "- **Cooking Scenarios**: Risk scores 30-50 (distinguishable from fire)\n",
    "- **Fire Events**: Risk scores 86-100 (high sensitivity for safety)\n",

    "## 5. Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section rigorously evaluates the trained Spatio-Temporal Transformer model to ensure it meets safety-critical performance requirements. Comprehensive testing validates that the model can reliably distinguish between normal conditions, cooking scenarios, and actual fire events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Rigorous Evaluation Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire detection is a safety-critical application where both false positives (unnecessary evacuations) and false negatives (missed fires) have serious consequences. Our evaluation framework ensures the model performs reliably across all scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📊 Quantitative Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores per scenario\n",
    "2. **🎯 Risk Score Validation**: Verify scores fall within expected ranges\n",
    "3. **⏱️ Temporal Consistency**: Ensure stable predictions over time\n",
    "4. **🔍 Edge Case Testing**: Evaluate performance on boundary conditions\n",
    "5. **📈 Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of prediction patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Expected Risk Score | Acceptance Criteria |\n",
    "|----------|-------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| Normal | 0-30 | >95% within range, stable over time |\n",
    "| Cooking | 30-50 | >90% within range, no critical alerts |\n",
    "| Fire | 86-100 | >98% within range, consistent detection |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario-Specific Testing**: Dedicated test sets for each scenario type\n",
    "- **Statistical Validation**: Confidence intervals and significance testing\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Performance plots and confusion matrices\n",
    "- **Inference Speed**: Real-time performance measurement\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: Resource consumption analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Special attention to safety-critical aspects:\n",
    "- **False Negative Rate**: Must be <2% for fire detection\n",
    "- **Cooking False Positives**: Must not trigger critical alerts\n",
    "- **Response Time**: Inference must complete within 100ms\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Performance under noisy conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automated Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation includes automated test suites that validate model performance and generate detailed reports for review."

    "## 6. Anti-Hallucination Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements the critical safety layer that prevents false alarms while maintaining high fire detection sensitivity. The anti-hallucination system combines ensemble voting, rule-based validation, and conservative risk assessment to ensure reliable operation in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hallucination Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "AI models can sometimes \"hallucinate\" - making confident predictions based on spurious patterns. In fire detection, this could mean:\n",
    "- **False Fire Alarms**: Mistaking cooking for fires (evacuation disruption)\n",
    "- **Overconfident Predictions**: High confidence in incorrect classifications\n",
    "- **Pattern Overfitting**: Learning artifacts instead of real fire signatures\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🗳️ Ensemble Voting System\n",
    "- **Multiple Models**: Primary transformer + secondary models + rule-based validator\n",
    "- **Agreement Requirement**: At least 2 out of 3 models must agree for critical alerts\n",
    "- **Confidence Weighting**: Higher confidence models have more influence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🍳 Cooking Pattern Detector\n",
    "- **Signature Recognition**: Identifies cooking-specific sensor patterns\n",
    "- **PM2.5/CO₂ Analysis**: High particulates without sustained temperature\n",
    "- **Temporal Patterns**: Cooking has different time signatures than fires\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔥 Fire Signature Validator\n",
    "- **Multi-Indicator Check**: Requires temperature + PM2.5 + audio anomalies\n",
    "- **Heat Signature**: Validates sustained high temperature readings\n",
    "- **Spatial Propagation**: Checks if fire patterns spread appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⏰ Temporal Consistency Checker\n",
    "- **Sustained Patterns**: Fire events must persist over minimum time window\n",
    "- **Trend Analysis**: Validates escalating vs. stable patterns\n",
    "- **Oscillation Prevention**: Prevents rapid alert level changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conservative Risk Assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher Thresholds**: Critical alerts require scores >85 (vs. raw model output)\n",
    "- **Multiple Confirmations**: Several validation layers must pass\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation**: System errs on side of caution\n",
    "- **Context Awareness**: Considers recent alert history and patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced False Alarms**: Cooking scenarios won't trigger evacuations\n",
    "- **Maintained Sensitivity**: True fires still detected reliably\n",
    "- **Explainable Decisions**: Clear reasoning for each alert level\n",
    "- **Robust Operation**: Handles edge cases and noisy conditions"
