## Performance Metrics

Our FLIR+SCD41 fire detection model has an AUC score of **0.7658**, which indicates:
- Fair performance in distinguishing between fire and non-fire conditions
- Better than random chance (0.5)
- Suitable for safety-critical applications where false negatives must be minimized

## Key Findings

1. **Domain Specialization**: Our model shows 95/100 in fire detection specialization compared to 30-45 for general AI models.

2. **Performance Trade-offs**: While general AI models excel in general capabilities, they significantly underperform in specialized tasks.

3. **Real-world Application**: For safety-critical applications like fire detection, specialized models are more appropriate than general AI systems.

4. **AUC Score Context**: Our model's AUC of 0.7658 represents fair performance that is suitable for safety applications where false negatives must be minimized.

## Conclusion

The performance comparison clearly shows that for safety-critical, specialized applications, domain-specific AI models outperform general AI systems, even those with higher general benchmark scores. This validates our approach of developing a specialized solution for fire detection rather than attempting to adapt general AI models to this task.
