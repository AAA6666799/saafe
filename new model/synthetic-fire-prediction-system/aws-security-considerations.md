# AWS Security Considerations for Synthetic Fire Prediction System

While this is a research/development system with minimal security concerns, implementing basic security best practices is still important to protect resources and prevent unauthorized access. This document outlines recommended security measures for the AWS architecture.

## Identity and Access Management

### IAM Policies and Roles

- **Least Privilege Principle**: Implement IAM roles with minimal permissions required for each component
- **Service Roles**: Create specific service roles for AWS Batch, Lambda, ECS, and other services
- **Access Keys**: Avoid using long-term access keys; use IAM roles for services instead
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and audit IAM permissions

### Authentication and Authorization

- **MFA**: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for IAM users with console access
- **Password Policies**: Enforce strong password policies for IAM users
- **Temporary Credentials**: Use temporary security credentials for human users

## Network Security

### VPC Configuration

- **Private Subnets**: Place sensitive components in private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Configure restrictive security groups with minimal required access
- **Network ACLs**: Implement network ACLs as an additional layer of security
- **VPC Endpoints**: Use VPC endpoints for AWS services to avoid public internet exposure

### API Security

- **API Gateway**: Implement throttling and request validation
- **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS for all API communications
- **CORS**: Configure appropriate CORS policies for web applications

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- **S3 Encryption**: Enable default encryption for S3 buckets
- **EBS Encryption**: Use encrypted EBS volumes for EC2 instances
- **KMS**: Use AWS KMS for key management
- **In-Transit Encryption**: Ensure all data in transit is encrypted using TLS

### Data Access Controls

- **S3 Bucket Policies**: Implement restrictive bucket policies
- **Presigned URLs**: Use presigned URLs for temporary access to S3 objects
- **Access Logging**: Enable access logging for S3 buckets

## Monitoring and Detection

### Logging

- **CloudTrail**: Enable AWS CloudTrail for API activity logging
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralize application logs in CloudWatch Logs
- **Log Retention**: Configure appropriate log retention periods

### Monitoring

- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up alarms for suspicious activities
- **GuardDuty**: Consider enabling AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
- **Security Hub**: Consider using AWS Security Hub for security posture management

## Infrastructure Security

### Configuration Management

- **CloudFormation**: Use CloudFormation for infrastructure as code
- **Config**: Consider enabling AWS Config for configuration monitoring
- **Systems Manager**: Use Systems Manager for patch management

### Container Security

- **ECR Scanning**: Enable image scanning in Amazon ECR
- **ECS Task Roles**: Use task roles with minimal permissions for ECS tasks
- **Image Hardening**: Use minimal base images and remove unnecessary components

## Incident Response

### Preparation

- **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular backups of critical data
- **Response Plan**: Develop a basic incident response plan
- **Contact List**: Maintain a list of responsible personnel

### Detection and Analysis

- **Alerts**: Configure alerts for security-related events
- **Investigation Process**: Define a process for investigating security incidents

## Security Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Configure IAM roles with least privilege permissions
- [ ] Set up VPC with public and private subnets
- [ ] Implement security groups and network ACLs
- [ ] Enable default encryption for S3 buckets
- [ ] Configure CloudTrail for API activity logging
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging
- [ ] Implement CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities
- [ ] Use CloudFormation for infrastructure deployment
- [ ] Enable image scanning in Amazon ECR
- [ ] Implement backup strategy for critical data

## Security Best Practices by Service

### Amazon S3

- Enable default encryption
- Implement bucket policies to restrict access
- Enable access logging
- Configure lifecycle policies for data management

### Amazon EC2

- Use security groups with minimal required access
- Deploy instances in private subnets where possible
- Use encrypted EBS volumes
- Keep instances patched and updated

### AWS Lambda

- Use execution roles with minimal permissions
- Configure environment variables with encryption
- Set appropriate timeout and memory settings
- Implement error handling and logging

### Amazon ECS/Fargate

- Use task roles with minimal permissions
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Implement secrets management for sensitive data
- Configure logging for containers

### Amazon SageMaker

- Deploy in private VPC where possible
- Use IAM roles for SageMaker execution
- Encrypt model artifacts and data
- Implement network isolation for training jobs

### API Gateway

- Configure throttling and request validation
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Use API keys for client identification
- Enable CloudWatch logging

## Conclusion

While this system has minimal security concerns as a research/development environment, implementing these basic security measures will help protect resources and establish good security practices. As the system matures or if it transitions to production use, security measures should be reviewed and enhanced accordingly.
