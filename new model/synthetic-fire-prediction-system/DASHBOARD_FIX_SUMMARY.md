# 🔥 Fire Detection System - Dashboard Fix Summary

## 📊 Issue Resolved

The dashboard was showing an error:
```
❌ ERROR - name 'pytz' is not defined
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue was with the pytz import in the Streamlit dashboard context. Even though pytz was imported at the top of the file, there were context issues with how it was being used within the cached functions.

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

1. **Added pytz import at the top of the file**:
   ```python
   import pytz  # Add this import
   ```

2. **Added local imports within the function** to ensure availability in the Streamlit context:
   ```python
   # Initialize S3 client
   s3 = clients['s3']
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   import pytz  # Local import for Streamlit context
   ```

3. **Updated S3 status checking logic** to use a more efficient approach:
   - Instead of listing all files and checking the first 100, the dashboard now searches specifically for today's files using prefixes
   - This approach is much more efficient and finds recent files correctly

## ✅ Expected Dashboard Behavior

After refreshing the dashboard, you should now see:

1. **No more pytz error**
2. **Status Change**: From "❌ ERROR" to "✅ OPERATIONAL"
3. **Live Data Detection**: If devices are sending data, you should see "✅ LIVE DATA DETECTED"
4. **Recent File Counts**: Non-zero counts for recent thermal and gas files
5. **Recent Files List**: Showing files from today with timestamps from the last hour
