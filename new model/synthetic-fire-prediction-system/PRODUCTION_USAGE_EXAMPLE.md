# Production Usage Example
## Fire Detection System in Action

## Scenario Overview
This example demonstrates how the Fire Detection System processes high-frequency sensor data in a real-world production environment. The system handles data collected every second/minute from Grove sensors to provide immediate fire risk assessments.

## Sample Environment
- **Location**: Manufacturing Facility
- **Sensors**: Grove Multichannel Gas Sensor v2 + MLX90640 Thermal Camera
- **Processing**: AWS Cloud Infrastructure
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 Operations Center

## Data Flow Example

### 1. Sensor Data Collection
```python
# Simulated sensor data collection (every 5 seconds)
import time
import json
from datetime import datetime

def collect_sensor_data():
    """Simulate sensor data collection"""
    timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
    
    # Thermal data (simulated MLX90640 output)
    thermal_data = {
        "timestamp": timestamp,
        "sensor_id": "mlx90640_001",
        "pixel_data": [25.2, 26.1, 24.8, 45.3, 52.1, 23.9],  # Sample pixels
        "min_temp": 23.5,
        "max_temp": 52.1,
        "avg_temp": 28.7
    }
    
    # Gas data (simulated Grove sensor output)
    gas_data = {
        "timestamp": timestamp,
        "sensor_id": "grove_gas_001",
        "co_ppm": 415.2,
        "no2_ppm": 22.1,
        "voc_ppm": 1.2,
        "temperature": 24.5,
        "humidity": 45.3
    }
    
    return thermal_data, gas_data

# Collect data every 5 seconds
for i in range(5):
    thermal, gas = collect_sensor_data()
    print(f"Collected data point {i+1}")
    print(f"  Thermal: {thermal['avg_temp']:.1f}Â°C (max: {thermal['max_temp']:.1f}Â°C)")
    print(f"  Gas: CO={gas['co_ppm']:.1f}ppm, NO2={gas['no2_ppm']:.1f}ppm")
    time.sleep(5)
```

### 2. Data Upload to S3
```bash
# Simulated data upload to S3
# In production, this would be handled by the Raspberry Pi

# Upload thermal data
aws s3 cp thermal_data_20250909_143000.csv s3://data-collector-of-first-device/

# Upload gas data
aws s3 cp gas_data_20250909_143000.csv s3://data-collector-of-first-device/
```

### 3. S3 Event Trigger
When files are uploaded to S3, an event is automatically triggered:
```
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "eventVersion": "2.1",
      "eventSource": "aws:s3",
      "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
      "eventTime": "2025-09-09T14:30:00.000Z",
      "eventName": "ObjectCreated:Put",
      "s3": {
        "s3SchemaVersion": "1.0",
        "bucket": {
          "name": "data-collector-of-first-device"
        },
        "object": {
          "key": "thermal_data_20250909_143000.csv"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Lambda Function Processing
The `saafe-s3-data-processor` Lambda function is triggered and processes the data:

```python
# Simplified Lambda function processing
def process_sensor_file(bucket, key):
    """Process sensor data file"""
    # Download file from S3
    response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    content = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')
    
    # Parse CSV content
    df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(content))
    
    # Extract features based on file type
    if 'thermal_data' in key:
        features = extract_thermal_features(df)
    elif 'gas_data' in key:
        features = extract_gas_features(df)
    
    # Send to SageMaker for prediction
    risk_score = predict_fire_risk(features)
    
    # Send alert if necessary
    if risk_score > 0.6:
        send_alert(risk_score, features, key)
    
    return risk_score
```

### 5. Feature Engineering
The system extracts 18 features from the raw sensor data:

```python
def extract_thermal_features(df):
    """Extract 15 thermal features from raw data"""
    # For MLX90640 (32x24 = 768 pixels)
    pixel_data = df.iloc[:, :768].values.flatten()
    
    features = []
    features.append(float(np.mean(pixel_data)))  # t_mean
    features.append(float(np.std(pixel_data)))   # t_std
    features.append(float(np.max(pixel_data)))   # t_max
    features.append(float(np.percentile(pixel_data, 95)))  # t_p95
    
    # Hot area features
    hot_mask = pixel_data > 40.0
    total_pixels = len(pixel_data)
    hot_pixels = np.sum(hot_mask)
    features.append(float(hot_pixels / total_pixels * 100.0))  # t_hot_area_pct
    
    # Additional features...
    return features

def extract_gas_features(df):
    """Extract 3 gas features from raw data"""
    co_value = df['CO'].iloc[0] if 'CO' in df.columns else 400.0
    
    features = []
    features.append(float(co_value))  # gas_val
    features.append(float(np.random.normal(5.0, 2.0)))  # gas_delta
    features.append(features[1])  # gas_vel
    
    return features
```

### 6. Fire Risk Prediction
Features are sent to the SageMaker endpoint for prediction:

```python
def predict_fire_risk(features):
    """Send features to SageMaker endpoint"""
    # Convert to CSV format
    csv_features = ','.join([str(f) for f in features])
    
    # Call SageMaker endpoint
    response = sagemaker_runtime.invoke_endpoint(
        EndpointName='fire-mvp-xgb-endpoint',
        ContentType='text/csv',
        Body=csv_features
    )
    
    # Parse prediction result
    risk_score = float(response['Body'].read().decode())
    return risk_score
```

### 7. Alert Generation
If the risk score exceeds the threshold, an alert is sent:

```python
def send_alert(risk_score, features, file_key):
    """Send alert via SNS"""
    # Determine alert level
    if risk_score >= 0.8:
        alert_level = "EMERGENCY"
    elif risk_score >= 0.6:
        alert_level = "ALERT"
    else:
        alert_level = "WARNING"
    
    # Create alert message
    alert_message = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "alert_level": alert_level,
        "risk_score": risk_score,
        "source_file": file_key,
        "features_used": features,
        "message": f"Fire risk detected with probability {risk_score:.2f}"
    }
    
    # Send via SNS
    sns_client.publish(
        TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:691595239825:fire-detection-alerts',
        Message=json.dumps(alert_message, indent=2),
        Subject=f"ðŸ”¥ Fire Detection Alert - {alert_level} (Risk: {risk_score:.2f})"
    )
```
