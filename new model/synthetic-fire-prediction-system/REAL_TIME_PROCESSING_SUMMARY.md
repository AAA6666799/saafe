# Real-Time High-Frequency Data Processing Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of real-time processing for high-frequency sensor data (collected every second/minute) which is a key selling point for the fire prediction system.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. S3 Data Processor Lambda Function
Created a new Lambda function `saafe-s3-data-processor` that processes S3 events in real-time:

- **Function Name**: `saafe-s3-data-processor`
- **Trigger**: S3 object creation events in bucket `data-collector-of-first-device`
- **Processing**: Extracts 18 features from thermal and gas data files
- **Prediction**: Sends features to SageMaker endpoint for fire risk prediction
- **Alerting**: Sends alerts via SNS when fire risk exceeds threshold

### 2. Key Features

#### Real-time Processing
- Processes data as soon as it arrives in S3
- Handles both thermal data (`thermal_data_*.csv`) and gas data (`gas_data_*.csv`) files
- Extracts all 18 features required by the XGBoost model

#### Feature Engineering
- **Thermal Features (15)**: t_mean, t_std, t_max, t_p95, t_hot_area_pct, t_hot_largest_blob_pct, t_grad_mean, t_grad_std, t_diff_mean, t_diff_std, flow_mag_mean, flow_mag_std, tproxy_val, tproxy_delta, tproxy_vel
- **Gas Features (3)**: gas_val, gas_delta, gas_vel

#### Fire Risk Prediction
- Integrates with existing SageMaker endpoint `fire-mvp-xgb-endpoint`
- Returns probability score between 0-1
- Alert levels:
  - 0.0-0.4: Low risk
  - 0.4-0.6: Medium risk (WARNING)
  - 0.6-0.8: High risk (ALERT)
  - 0.8-1.0: Critical risk (EMERGENCY)

#### Alerting System
- Sends alerts via SNS topic `fire-detection-alerts`
- Different alert levels based on risk score
- Includes timestamp, risk level, score, and source file information

### 3. Deployment
- Created deployment script `deploy_s3_processor.sh`
- Configured S3 event triggers
- Set up proper IAM permissions
- Function deployed with 900-second timeout and 1024MB memory

### 4. Testing
- Created test script `test_s3_processor.py`
- Verified local functionality
- Tested remote deployment
- Uploaded sample files to S3 to trigger processing

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Grove sensors collect data every second/minute
2. Data is uploaded as CSV files to S3 bucket `data-collector-of-first-device`
3. S3 object creation events trigger Lambda function `saafe-s3-data-processor`
4. Lambda function processes raw data and extracts features
5. Features are sent to SageMaker endpoint for prediction
6. High-risk predictions trigger SNS alerts

### Components
- **S3 Bucket**: `data-collector-of-first-device` (data source)
- **Lambda Function**: `saafe-s3-data-processor` (processing engine)
- **SageMaker Endpoint**: `fire-mvp-xgb-endpoint` (prediction model)
- **SNS Topic**: `fire-detection-alerts` (alerting system)

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- AWS Lambda automatically scales to handle high-frequency data
- Each file processed independently
- No bottlenecks for concurrent processing

### Latency
- Near real-time processing (seconds after file upload)
- Minimal delay between data collection and prediction

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Configuration

### Environment
- **AWS Region**: us-east-1
- **Timeout**: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
- **Memory**: 1024 MB
- **Runtime**: Python 3.9

### Dependencies
- pandas 1.3.5
- numpy 1.21.6

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch
- Logs available in `/aws/lambda/saafe-s3-data-processor`
- Metrics for invocations, duration, errors

### Alerting
- SNS notifications for high-risk predictions
- Different severity levels based on risk score

## Next Steps

### 1. Monitor Production Performance
- Watch CloudWatch logs for errors
- Monitor processing latency
- Track alert frequency and accuracy

### 2. Optimize Performance
- Fine-tune memory and timeout settings
- Optimize feature extraction algorithms
- Consider batching for very high-frequency scenarios

### 3. Enhance Alerting
- Add more detailed alert information
- Implement alert deduplication
- Add escalation procedures

### 4. Improve Testing
- Add unit tests for feature extraction
- Implement integration tests with S3
- Add performance benchmarks

## Conclusion
The real-time high-frequency data processing system is now fully implemented and deployed. The solution leverages AWS Lambda for scalable, low-latency processing of sensor data, integrates with the existing SageMaker prediction model, and provides comprehensive alerting capabilities. This implementation directly addresses the key selling point of processing data collected every second/minute for real-time fire prediction.
