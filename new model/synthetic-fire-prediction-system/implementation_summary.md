# MLX90640 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Grove MLX90640 thermal imaging camera interface for the synthetic fire prediction system. The implementation replaces the previous FLIR Lepton 3.5 thermal camera with the Grove MLX90640.

## Hardware Changes
- **Previous**: FLIR Lepton 3.5 thermal camera (160×120 resolution) + SCD41 CO₂ sensor
- **New**: Grove Multichannel Gas Sensor v2 + Grove Thermal Imaging Camera (MLX90640, 32×24 resolution)

## Implementation Details

### 1. MLX90640 Interface (`src/hardware/specific/mlx90640_interface.py`)
- Created a new interface implementation based on the existing MLX90641 interface
- Supports the correct resolution for MLX90640: 32×24 pixels
- Implements all required methods from the [ThermalSensorInterface](file:///Volumes/Ajay/saafe%20copy%203/new%20model/synthetic-fire-prediction-system/src/hardware/base.py#L105-L156)
- Includes proper configuration validation
- Provides mock implementation when hardware libraries are not available
- Added a convenience function for easy instantiation

### 2. Hardware Configuration (`config/hardware_config.json`)
- Updated to use `grove_mlx90640` as the sensor type
- Set resolution to [32, 24] to match MLX90640 specifications
- Configured device address to 51 (0x33 in hex)

### 3. Hardware Abstraction Layer (`src/hardware/base.py`)
- Updated [_initialize_thermal_sensor](file:///Volumes/Ajay/saafe%20copy%203/new%20model/synthetic-fire-prediction-system/src/hardware/base.py#L289-L317) method to recognize `grove_mlx90640` sensor type
- Added import and instantiation of MLX90640 interface

### 4. Module Exports (`src/hardware/specific/__init__.py`)
- Added imports for MLX90640 interface and convenience function
- Updated `__all__` list to include new exports

## Key Features
- **Resolution Support**: Correctly handles 32×24 pixel resolution of MLX90640
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensures proper configuration parameters
- **Mock Implementation**: Works without actual hardware for testing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains the same interface as other thermal sensors
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling and logging

## Testing
The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:
1. Direct instantiation using hardware configuration
2. Convenience function usage
3. Method implementation verification
4. Resolution and temperature range validation
5. Connection and data reading functionality

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the MLX90640 interface is correctly implemented and functional.

## Files Modified/Added
1. `src/hardware/specific/mlx90640_interface.py` (New)
2. `config/hardware_config.json` (Modified)
3. `src/hardware/base.py` (Modified)
4. `src/hardware/specific/__init__.py` (Modified)
5. Test scripts for verification (New)

## Usage
The MLX90640 sensor can be used through the HardwareAbstractionLayer just like any other thermal sensor, or instantiated directly using the provided interface class or convenience function.
