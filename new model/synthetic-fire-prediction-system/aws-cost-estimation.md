# AWS Cost Estimation for Synthetic Fire Prediction System

This document provides an estimated monthly cost breakdown for the AWS services used in the synthetic fire prediction system. These estimates are based on typical usage patterns and should be adjusted based on actual implementation details.

## Cost Optimization Strategy

Since cost is a secondary concern compared to building a robust, scalable architecture, this estimation focuses on providing adequate resources for performance while implementing reasonable cost optimization measures:

1. Use Spot Instances for non-time-critical batch processing
2. Implement auto-scaling to match resource usage with demand
3. Use appropriate storage tiers based on access patterns
4. Leverage reserved instances for baseline capacity

| **Total** | **$5,480 - $8,550** |

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

1. **Development vs. Production Environment**
   - Maintain a scaled-down development environment
   - Use smaller/fewer instances in non-production
   - Shut down non-production resources when not in use

2. **Reserved Instances**
   - Purchase 1-year reserved instances for baseline capacity
   - Potential savings: 20-40% on steady-state compute costs

3. **Spot Instances**
   - Use for batch processing and non-critical workloads
   - Potential savings: 60-90% on eligible workloads

4. **Storage Optimization**
   - Implement S3 lifecycle policies to move older data to cheaper storage tiers
   - Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with changing access patterns

5. **Right-sizing Resources**
   - Monitor resource utilization and adjust instance sizes
   - Implement auto-scaling to match capacity with demand

6. **Savings Plans**
   - Consider Compute Savings Plans for flexible compute commitments
   - Potential savings: 20-50% on eligible services

## Cost Monitoring Strategy

1. **AWS Cost Explorer**
   - Set up regular cost reports
   - Create custom dashboards for key cost metrics

2. **AWS Budgets**
   - Create budgets with alerts for each major component
   - Set up notifications for unusual spending patterns

3. **Resource Tagging**
   - Implement comprehensive tagging strategy
   - Track costs by project, environment, and component

4. **Regular Reviews**
   - Conduct monthly cost optimization reviews
   - Identify and address cost anomalies

## Notes and Assumptions

- Costs are estimates based on US East (N. Virginia) region pricing
- Actual costs will vary based on usage patterns, region, and specific implementation details
- Estimates do not include AWS support plans or one-time setup costs
- Pricing is based on AWS pricing as of August 2025 and subject to change
