# üî• Fire Detection System - Live Data Status

## üìä Current Status

After analyzing your S3 bucket `data-collector-of-first-device`, I've identified an important issue:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è No Live Data from Deployed Devices

**Findings:**
- **Total files in bucket:** 100 files
- **Files from last hour:** 0 files
- **Most recent file:** September 7, 2025 (2 days ago)
- **All files are old test data:** Created during initial installation

### üéØ Dashboard Updated

I've modified the Streamlit dashboard to:
1. **Filter for only recent files** (last hour) instead of showing all files
2. **Clearly indicate when no live data is detected**
3. **Provide troubleshooting guidance** for device connectivity issues
4. **Focus on live data monitoring** rather than historical test data

## üöÄ Dashboard Access

The updated dashboard is now running at: `http://0.0.0.0:8502`

**Key Features:**
- Real-time status of all system components
- Live data detection (shows warning when no recent data)
- Troubleshooting guidance
- Performance metrics
- End-to-end workflow visualization

## üîß Root Cause Analysis

The lack of live data indicates that your deployed devices are not currently sending data to the S3 bucket. This could be due to:

1. **Device connectivity issues**
   - Internet connection problems
   - Power supply issues
   - Network configuration errors

2. **Device configuration issues**
   - Incorrect S3 bucket name
   - Invalid AWS credentials
   - Wrong file naming convention

3. **Device hardware issues**
   - Sensor malfunctions
   - Storage full
   - Clock synchronization problems

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Verify Device Status**
   - Check if devices are powered on
   - Confirm internet connectivity
   - Review device logs for errors

2. **Check Device Configuration**
   - Verify S3 bucket name: `data-collector-of-first-device`
   - Confirm AWS credentials are valid
   - Ensure correct file naming format:
     - Thermal data: `thermal_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
     - Gas data: `gas_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

3. **Monitor Dashboard**
   - Refresh the dashboard at `http://0.0.0.0:8502`
   - Look for the "‚úÖ LIVE DATA DETECTED" indicator
   - Watch for recent file uploads

### Verification Commands:

```bash
# Check if devices are sending data
aws s3 ls s3://data-collector-of-first-device --region us-east-1

# Check Lambda function logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/saafe-s3-data-processor --region us-east-1
```

## üìà When Live Data Resumes

Once your devices start sending live data:

1. The dashboard will show "‚úÖ LIVE DATA DETECTED"
2. Recent file counts will update in real-time
3. The system will process data through the Lambda function
4. Fire risk predictions will be generated by SageMaker
5. Alerts will be sent via SNS (if subscriptions are configured)

## ‚úÖ Summary

Your dashboard is now properly configured to show only live data from deployed devices, not historical test data. The current lack of live data indicates a device connectivity or configuration issue that needs to be resolved. Once devices resume sending data, the dashboard will automatically detect and display the live data stream.

The dashboard is accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:8502` and will update every 30 seconds with the latest system status.
