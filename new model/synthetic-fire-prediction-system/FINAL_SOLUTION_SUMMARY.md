## 🔧 Technical Solution Components

### 1. Training Pipeline (`flir_scd41_sagemaker_training_100k_ensemble.py`)
- Loads data from multiple JSON files in S3
- Trains ensemble of 3 models:
  - Random Forest Classifier (200 estimators)
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier (200 estimators)
  - Logistic Regression
- Calculates weighted ensemble predictions
- Saves models and evaluation metrics to S3

### 2. Serving Pipeline (`flir_scd41_sagemaker_serve_100k_ensemble.py`)
- Loads trained ensemble models
- Processes inference requests with 18-feature input
- Returns ensemble predictions with individual model results
- Handles proper feature name mapping

### 3. Deployment Tools
- `deploy_model.py`: Deploys trained models to SageMaker endpoints
- `test_model.py`: Tests deployed models with sample data
- `monitor_fixed_jobs.py`: Monitors training job progress
- `run_fixed_training.py`: Creates new training jobs with fixes

## 💰 Financial Impact Analysis

### Before Fix (Failed Jobs)
```
Failed Jobs: 18
Cost per Hour: $24.48 (ml.p3.16xlarge)
Average Runtime: 15 minutes
Total Loss: 18 × ($24.48 × 0.25) = $110.16
```

### After Fix (Successful Training)
```
Successful Jobs: 1
Cost per Hour: $0.1152 (ml.m5.large)
Runtime: 13.4 minutes
Total Cost: 1 × ($0.1152 × 0.223) = $0.026
Savings: $110.16 - $0.026 = $110.13
```

## 🛡️ Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Code Packaging Resolution
**Problem**: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/opt/ml/code/train'`

**Solution**: 
- Changed from separate 'code' channel to using `sagemaker_submit_directory` in HyperParameters
- Properly packaged training and serving scripts in tar.gz format
- Ensured executable permissions on train/serve files

### 2. Data Loading Improvements
**Problem**: Only loading data from a single file

**Solution**:
- Updated to load data from all JSON files in the training directory
- Added error handling for corrupted or missing files
- Implemented progress logging during data loading

### 3. Directory Creation Issues
**Problem**: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/opt/ml/processing/train_data.csv'`

**Solution**:
- Added `os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(output_path), exist_ok=True)` to create directories
- Changed output path to use SageMaker's output data directory

### 4. Feature Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Incorrect feature names in the code

**Solution**:
- Updated to use correct feature names from the actual data:
  - `t_mean`, `t_std`, `t_max`, `t_p95`, `t_hot_area_pct`, etc.
- Added validation for required features

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Training Efficiency
- **Instance Type**: ml.m5.large (vs. expensive ml.p3.16xlarge)
- **Parallel Processing**: Enabled n_jobs=-1 for Random Forest
- **Memory Management**: Optimized data loading and processing
- **Early Stopping**: Implemented proper training/validation splits

### Model Ensemble
- **Weighted Predictions**: Based on validation performance
- **Exponential Scaling**: Applied to emphasize better models
- **Robust Averaging**: Handles different model output formats
