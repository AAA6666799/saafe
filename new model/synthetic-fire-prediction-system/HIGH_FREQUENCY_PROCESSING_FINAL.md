# High-Frequency Data Processing for Real-Time Fire Prediction

## Executive Summary
This document explains how the system processes high-frequency sensor data (collected every second/minute) which is a key selling point for real-time fire prediction. The implementation leverages AWS services to provide scalable, low-latency processing of sensor data for immediate fire risk assessment.

## Key Selling Point Addressed
The high-frequency data collection and processing capability is now fully implemented:
- **Data Collection**: Grove sensors collect data every second/minute
- **Real-time Processing**: Data is processed immediately upon arrival in S3
- **Immediate Response**: Fire risk predictions are generated in real-time
- **Scalable Architecture**: System automatically scales to handle data volume

## System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Sensor Collection**: Grove Multichannel Gas Sensor v2 + Grove Thermal Imaging Camera (MLX90640) collect data
2. **Data Storage**: Raw sensor data uploaded as CSV files to S3 bucket `data-collector-of-first-device`
3. **Event Trigger**: S3 object creation events trigger Lambda function `saafe-s3-data-processor`
4. **Feature Engineering**: Raw data processed to extract 18 features required by the model
5. **Fire Prediction**: Features sent to SageMaker endpoint `fire-mvp-xgb-endpoint` for prediction
6. **Alerting**: High-risk predictions trigger SNS alerts via `fire-detection-alerts` topic

### Components
- **S3 Bucket**: `data-collector-of-first-device` (stores raw sensor data)
- **Lambda Function**: `saafe-s3-data-processor` (processes data in real-time)
- **SageMaker Endpoint**: `fire-mvp-xgb-endpoint` (provides fire risk predictions)
- **SNS Topic**: `fire-detection-alerts` (sends alerts for high-risk detections)

## Implementation Details

### Real-time Processing
The system processes data as soon as it arrives in S3, ensuring minimal latency between data collection and fire risk assessment:

- **Trigger Mechanism**: S3 event notifications trigger processing within seconds of data arrival
- **Independent Processing**: Each file processed independently for maximum throughput
- **Automatic Scaling**: AWS Lambda automatically scales to handle data volume spikes

### Feature Engineering
The Lambda function extracts all 18 features required by the XGBoost model:

#### Thermal Features (15 features)
1. `t_mean`: Mean temperature across all pixels
2. `t_std`: Standard deviation of temperatures
3. `t_max`: Maximum temperature reading
4. `t_p95`: 95th percentile temperature
5. `t_hot_area_pct`: Percentage of area with temperatures >40Â°C
6. `t_hot_largest_blob_pct`: Largest contiguous hot area percentage
7. `t_grad_mean`: Mean temperature gradient
8. `t_grad_std`: Standard deviation of temperature gradients
9. `t_diff_mean`: Mean temporal temperature difference
10. `t_diff_std`: Standard deviation of temporal differences
11. `flow_mag_mean`: Mean optical flow magnitude
12. `flow_mag_std`: Standard deviation of optical flow
13. `tproxy_val`: Temperature proxy value
14. `tproxy_delta`: Temperature proxy change
15. `tproxy_vel`: Temperature proxy velocity

#### Gas Features (3 features)
16. `gas_val`: Gas concentration value
17. `gas_delta`: Change in gas concentration
18. `gas_vel`: Rate of change in gas concentration

### Fire Risk Prediction
The extracted features are sent to the deployed XGBoost model via the SageMaker endpoint, which returns a probability score between 0 and 1:

- **0.0-0.4**: Low risk
- **0.4-0.6**: Medium risk (WARNING level)
- **0.6-0.8**: High risk (ALERT level)
- **0.8-1.0**: Critical risk (EMERGENCY level)

### Alerting System
When fire risk exceeds the threshold (0.6), alerts are sent via SNS with detailed information:

- Timestamp of detection
- Risk level (WARNING/ALERT/EMERGENCY)
- Risk probability score
- Source data file name
