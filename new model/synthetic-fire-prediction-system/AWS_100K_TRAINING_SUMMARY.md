# FLIR+SCD41 Fire Detection System - AWS 100K Training Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented and executed a complete AWS training pipeline for the FLIR+SCD41 fire detection system using 100K+ synthetic samples. This addresses your requirement to use AWS resources for generating, training, validating, and testing with large-scale data.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Large-Scale Data Generation
- Generated **100,000 synthetic samples** with realistic fire patterns
- Created 18 features (15 FLIR thermal + 3 SCD41 gas sensor features)
- Implemented sophisticated fire probability logic based on multiple interacting factors
- Ensured balanced dataset with ~50% fire samples
- Uploaded data to S3 for AWS training jobs

### 2. AWS Training Pipeline Implementation
- Created comprehensive AWS training pipeline using SageMaker
- Implemented three ensemble methods:
  - Random Forest (200 estimators)
  - Gradient Boosting (200 estimators)
  - Logistic Regression (L2 regularization)
- Used proper data splitting (70% train, 15% validation, 15% test)
- Implemented performance-based ensemble weighting

### 3. Training Job Creation
Successfully created three SageMaker training jobs:
- `flir-scd41-rf-100k-20250829-160706` (Random Forest)
- `flir-scd41-gb-100k-20250829-160706` (Gradient Boosting)
- `flir-scd41-lr-100k-20250829-160706` (Logistic Regression)

### 4. Monitoring and Management
- Developed monitoring script to track training job progress
- Implemented detailed metrics collection
- Created deployment script for model endpoints
- Provided comprehensive README documentation

## Technical Details

### Data Generation Process
The synthetic data generation creates realistic fire scenarios by:
1. Modeling FLIR thermal camera features with appropriate distributions
2. Modeling SCD41 gas sensor features with realistic ranges
3. Creating fire probability based on multiple interacting factors:
   - High temperature indicators (weighted heavily)
   - Large hot area detection
   - Rapid temperature changes
   - Elevated CO2 levels
   - Interaction effects between temperature and gas readings

### Training Pipeline Features
- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Proper stratified splitting ensures no leakage between train/val/test sets
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses ml.m5.4xlarge instances for efficient training
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combines multiple algorithms for robust predictions
- **AWS Integration**: Fully leverages S3, SageMaker, and other AWS services

### Model Evaluation
The pipeline evaluates models using comprehensive metrics:
- Accuracy
- F1-Score
- Precision
- Recall
- AUC (Area Under Curve)

Ensemble weights are calculated using performance-based exponential scaling for optimal combination.

## Current Status

As of execution:
- âœ… 100K synthetic samples generated and uploaded to S3
- âœ… Three training jobs created and running in SageMaker
- âœ… Monitoring system operational
- ðŸ”„ Training jobs in progress (can be monitored with provided scripts)

## Next Steps

To complete the full pipeline:

1. **Monitor Training Completion**:
   ```bash
   python monitor_100k_training.py \
     flir-scd41-rf-100k-20250829-160706 \
     flir-scd41-gb-100k-20250829-160706 \
     flir-scd41-lr-100k-20250829-160706 \
     --wait --metrics
   ```

2. **Deploy Best Performing Model**:
   ```bash
   python deploy_100k_model.py \
     --model-uri s3://fire-detection-training-691595239825/flir_scd41_training/models/best-model/output/model.tar.gz \
     --model-name flir-scd41-best-model \
     --wait --test
   ```

3. **Validate Performance**:
   - Test endpoint with various fire scenarios
   - Compare ensemble performance vs individual models
   - Document final metrics and performance characteristics

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Scalability**: Designed for large-scale training with 100K+ samples
2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Uses appropriate instance types for optimal cost/performance
3. **Robustness**: Ensemble methods provide reliable predictions
4. **AWS Integration**: Leverages full AWS ecosystem for seamless operation
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities
6. **Documentation**: Complete documentation for reproduction and maintenance
