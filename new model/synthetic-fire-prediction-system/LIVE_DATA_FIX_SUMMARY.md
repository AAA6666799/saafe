# 🔥 Fire Detection System - Live Data Detection Fix

## 📊 Issue Summary

There was a discrepancy between what you observed in the S3 console and what the dashboard was reporting:

### What You Observed:
- File: `gas_data_20250909_132755.csv`
- Timestamp: September 9, 2025, 13:28:05 (UTC+01:00)
- This file was very recent (just a few minutes old)

### What the Dashboard Was Reporting:
- "⚠️ NO RECENT LIVE DATA"
- Most recent file was from September 9, 2025, 09:36:25 UTC
- This file was about 2-3 hours old

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was with how the dashboard was checking for recent files in the S3 bucket:

1. **Inefficient File Listing**: The dashboard was only checking the first 100 files returned by the S3 list operation
2. **Large Bucket Size**: The bucket contains over 5,500 files, with the most recent files not appearing in the first 100
3. **File Organization**: Files are organized by date in prefixes (e.g., `gas-data/gas_data_20250909_...`), but the simple list operation was returning older files first

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

I've updated the dashboard code to use a more efficient approach:

### Before (Problematic):
```python
# List first 100 files and check if any are recent
response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket='data-collector-of-first-device', MaxKeys=100)
# Check all files in response['Contents'] for recent ones
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Use prefix-based search for today's files
today_str = utc_now.strftime('%Y%m%d')

# Search for gas data files from today
paginator = s3.get_paginator('list_objects_v2')
gas_pages = paginator.paginate(
    Bucket='data-collector-of-first-device',
    Prefix=f'gas-data/gas_data_{today_str}'
)

# Search for thermal data files from today
thermal_pages = paginator.paginate(
    Bucket='data-collector-of-first-device',
    Prefix=f'thermal-data/thermal_data_{today_str}'
)

# Check files from both searches for recent ones (last hour)
```

## ✅ Verification

Based on my testing, this approach successfully finds recent files:

- **Recent gas files found**: Files from today (September 9, 2025) about 27 minutes old
- **Recent thermal files found**: Files from today (September 9, 2025) about 27 minutes old
- **Dashboard should now detect**: "✅ LIVE DATA DETECTED"

## 📈 Expected Dashboard Behavior After Fix

When you refresh the dashboard, you should now see:

1. **Status Change**: From "⚠️ NO RECENT LIVE DATA" to "✅ LIVE DATA DETECTED"
2. **File Counts**: 
   - Recent Thermal Files (Last Hour): Non-zero count
   - Recent Gas Files (Last Hour): Non-zero count
3. **Recent Files List**: Showing files from today with timestamps from the last hour
4. **System Status**: Green "✅ SYSTEM OPERATIONAL" indicator

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Refresh the Dashboard**: Click the "🔄 Refresh" button or wait for the automatic 30-second refresh
2. **Verify Status Change**: Confirm that the dashboard now shows "✅ LIVE DATA DETECTED"
3. **Monitor Continuously**: The dashboard will continue to monitor for live data every 30 seconds
