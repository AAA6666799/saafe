# AWS Architecture for Synthetic Fire Prediction System - Summary

This document provides an overview of the AWS architecture design for the synthetic fire prediction system. It serves as an index to the detailed documents created for this architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The AWS architecture for the synthetic fire prediction system is designed to be robust, highly scalable, and capable of handling variable workloads with occasional massive spikes. The architecture is organized into several layers:

1. **Data Generation Layer**: AWS Batch and EC2 GPU instances for generating synthetic thermal, gas, and environmental data
2. **Feature Engineering Layer**: Amazon EMR and AWS Glue for extracting and processing features
3. **Model Training Layer**: Amazon SageMaker for training, tuning, and managing ML models
4. **Agent System Layer**: ECS/Fargate and Lambda for implementing the multi-agent architecture
5. **Deployment & Inference Layer**: SageMaker Endpoints and API Gateway for model serving
6. **Monitoring & Management Layer**: CloudWatch and X-Ray for system monitoring and observability
