# FLIR+SCD41 Fire Detection System - AWS Pipeline Summary

This document outlines how AWS resources are used throughout the entire machine learning pipeline for the FLIR+SCD41 fire detection system.

## Pipeline Overview

The complete pipeline uses AWS services for:
1. **Data Generation** - Synthetic data creation and storage
2. **Model Training** - Distributed training on SageMaker
3. **Model Validation** - Automated evaluation during training
4. **Model Testing** - Endpoint deployment and testing
5. **Model Deployment** - Production-ready endpoints

## AWS Services Used

### Amazon S3
- **Purpose**: Data storage and model artifact management
- **Usage**:
  - Store 100K+ synthetic training samples in CSV format
  - Store packaged training code (tar.gz files)
  - Store trained model artifacts
  - Store evaluation results and metrics

### Amazon SageMaker
- **Purpose**: Machine learning training and deployment
- **Usage**:
  - Training jobs for ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression)
  - Model hosting on managed endpoints
  - Distributed training on ml.m5.4xlarge instances
  - Automatic scaling and resource management

### IAM Roles
- **Purpose**: Secure access to AWS resources
- **Usage**:
  - SageMakerExecutionRole for training and deployment permissions
  - Controlled access to S3 buckets

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Data Generation (`aws_100k_training_pipeline.py`)
- Generates 100K+ realistic synthetic samples using NumPy
- Features include 15 thermal (FLIR) and 3 gas (SCD41) sensor readings
- Uploads data to S3 bucket for distributed training
- Uses realistic fire probability models with interaction effects

### 2. Model Training
- **Training Jobs**: Three parallel SageMaker jobs for ensemble methods
- **Instance Type**: ml.m5.4xlarge for compute-intensive training
- **Code Packaging**: Automated packaging of training/inference scripts
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Built-in optimization for each algorithm

### 3. Model Validation
- Automatic train/validation/test split with stratification
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall, AUC
- Ensemble weighting based on validation performance
- Real-time monitoring of training progress

### 4. Model Deployment
- Deploy trained models to SageMaker endpoints
- Automatic endpoint configuration and scaling
- Test endpoint functionality with sample data
- Monitor endpoint health and performance

## Resource Utilization

### Compute Resources
- **Training**: 3 × ml.m5.4xlarge instances (16 vCPU, 64 GiB memory each)
- **Deployment**: 1 × ml.t2.medium instance (2 vCPU, 4 GiB memory)
- **Storage**: S3 Standard storage for datasets and models

### Estimated Costs
- **Training**: ~$12-15 per hour per instance (4-hour training = ~$150 total)
- **Deployment**: ~$0.06 per hour (can be shut down when not needed)
- **Storage**: ~$0.023 per GB per month

## Monitoring and Management

### Training Monitoring
- Real-time status updates via `monitor_100k_training.py`
- Detailed metrics collection during training
- Automatic failure detection and reporting

### Deployment Monitoring
- Endpoint health checks
- Performance testing with sample data
- Automatic scaling recommendations

## Security and Compliance

### Data Protection
- All data stored in private S3 buckets
- IAM role-based access control
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### Model Security
- Secure model deployment with VPC support
- Authentication and authorization for endpoints
- Audit logging for all operations

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Training Completion**: Monitor jobs until all complete
2. **Evaluate Results**: Analyze performance metrics to select best model
3. **Deploy Endpoint**: Deploy the best performing model to SageMaker endpoint
4. **Test Integration**: Validate endpoint with real-world scenarios
5. **Optimize Costs**: Shut down endpoints when not in use

## Commands for Manual Operations

### Check Training Status
```bash
python monitor_100k_training.py \
  flir-scd41-rf-100k-20250829-161531 \
  flir-scd41-gb-100k-20250829-161531 \
  flir-scd41-lr-100k-20250829-161531
```

### Deploy Model
```bash
python deploy_100k_model.py \
  --model-uri s3://fire-detection-training-691595239825/flir_scd41_training/models/flir-scd41-rf-100k-20250829-161531/output/model.tar.gz \
  --model-name flir-scd41-rf-best-20250829 \
  --wait \
  --test
```

### Check S3 Contents
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://fire-detection-training-691595239825/flir_scd41_training/ --recursive
```
