# Cloud Deployment Status

## Overview
This document summarizes the current deployment status of the synthetic fire prediction system on AWS cloud services.

## Deployed Components

### AWS Lambda Functions
All three real-time agents have been successfully deployed as AWS Lambda functions:

1. **saafe-monitoring-agent**
   - Runtime: Python 3.9
   - Handler: monitoring_agent.lambda_handler
   - Status: Deployed and active

2. **saafe-analysis-agent**
   - Runtime: Python 3.9
   - Handler: analysis_agent.lambda_handler
   - Status: Deployed and active

3. **saafe-response-agent**
   - Runtime: Python 3.9
   - Handler: response_agent.lambda_handler
   - Status: Deployed and active

### CloudWatch Event Rules
1. **saafe-monitoring-schedule**
   - Schedule: rate(5 minutes)
   - State: ENABLED
   - Purpose: Triggers the monitoring agent every 5 minutes

### CloudWatch Log Groups
All Lambda functions have corresponding log groups for monitoring and debugging:
- /aws/lambda/saafe-monitoring-agent
- /aws/lambda/saafe-analysis-agent
- /aws/lambda/saafe-response-agent

### S3 Buckets
The following S3 buckets are available for the system:
- processedd-synthetic-data (for synthetic data storage)
- synthetic-data-4 (additional data storage)

## Undeployed Components

### SageMaker
No models or endpoints are currently deployed to SageMaker:
- Models: 0
- Endpoints: 0

## Configuration Summary

### AWS Regions
- Lambda Functions: us-east-1
- SageMaker: us-west-2
- S3 Buckets: Various regions

### Account Information
- Account ID: 691595239825
- IAM User: model-train-cli

## Next Steps

1. **Model Deployment**: Deploy trained models to SageMaker endpoints for real-time inference
2. **SNS Configuration**: Set up SNS topics for alert notifications
3. **Additional Event Triggers**: Configure more CloudWatch event rules for different agent triggers
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create CloudWatch dashboards for system monitoring
5. **Security Review**: Verify IAM roles and permissions for all deployed components

## Verification Commands

The following AWS CLI commands were used to verify the deployment status:

```bash
# List Lambda functions
aws lambda list-functions --region us-east-1 | grep saafe

# Check specific Lambda function
aws lambda get-function --function-name saafe-monitoring-agent --region us-east-1

# List CloudWatch event rules
aws events list-rules --region us-east-1 | grep saafe

# Check CloudWatch log groups
aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /aws/lambda/saafe --region us-east-1

# List S3 buckets
aws s3 ls | grep synthetic

# Check SageMaker models
aws sagemaker list-models --region us-west-2

# Check SageMaker endpoints
aws sagemaker list-endpoints --region us-west-2
```

## Conclusion

The real-time agent system is fully deployed on AWS Lambda with proper scheduling. The next step would be to deploy the trained ML models to SageMaker for inference capabilities.
