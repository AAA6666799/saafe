## 14. Additional Notes

### 14.1 Repository Structure
The repository follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:
- Core business logic is separated from infrastructure concerns
- Models are isolated from application code
- Agents operate independently but coordinate through a central system
- Hardware abstraction allows for easy sensor integration

### 14.2 Development Best Practices
- Code follows PEP8 standards
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Documentation is maintained with code changes
- Security considerations are addressed in design

### 14.3 Performance Considerations
- Model inference time is optimized for real-time processing
- Memory usage is monitored and optimized
- Scalability is built into the architecture
- Caching strategies are implemented where appropriate

### 14.4 Future Development Roadmap
1. Mobile application development
2. Advanced analytics and reporting features
3. Integration with building management systems
4. Multi-tenant architecture for service providers
5. Global deployment with multi-region support

This checklist ensures a complete and smooth handover of the Saafe Fire Detection System codebase to the receiving team or organization.
