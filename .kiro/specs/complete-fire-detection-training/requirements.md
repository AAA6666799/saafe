2. WHEN training deep learning models THEN the system SHALL utilize GPU acceleration when available
3. WHEN training is complete THEN the system SHALL save all 16+ models to S3 with timestamp-based versioning
4. WHEN saving models THEN the system SHALL include model metadata, performance metrics, and training configuration
5. WHEN training fails for any model THEN the system SHALL continue training other models and report failures clearly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a fire safety analyst, I want comprehensive performance evaluation and comparison across all algorithms, so that I can understand which models work best for different fire scenarios and building areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is complete THEN the system SHALL generate performance metrics for each of the 16+ models including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create visualizations comparing model performance and feature importance
5. WHEN models achieve target performance THEN the system SHALL validate that ensemble accuracy reaches 97-98% as advertised

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the training system to be robust and production-ready with proper error handling and monitoring, so that it can run reliably in automated training pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any model training fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with remaining models
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement data streaming and model checkpointing
3. WHEN training takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and estimated completion times
4. WHEN training is interrupted THEN the system SHALL support resuming from the last successful checkpoint
5. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL validate all saved models can be loaded and make predictions correctly
